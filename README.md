### Swift Demo Program for Kvaser CAN Leaf Interfaces (macOS&reg;)

_Copyright &copy; 2021  Uwe Vogt, UV Software, Berlin (info@mac-can.com)_

# Running CAN on Mac&reg;

_Running CAN on Mac_ is the mission of the MacCAN project.
The macOS driver for CAN Leaf interfaces from [Kvaser](https://www.kvaser.com) is based on _MacCAN-Core_ which is an abstraction (or rather a wrapper) of AppleÂ´s IOUsbKit to create USB user-space drivers for CAN interfaces from various vendors under macOS.

## SwiftCAN-KvaserCAN

This repo contains only a little example program that uses the [MacCAN-KvaserCAN](https://github.com/mac-can/MacCAN-KvaserCAN/) Swift wrapper as a required package dependency.
Feel free to modify the program.
